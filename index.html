    <p>Welcome to my first webpage hosted by me, yours truly.  Here you will find nothing less than pain, utter buffoonery, and deviant creativity all in the name of jokes.  "One man's joke is another man's ulcer."  Life requires some bit of fun, so why not?</p><br/>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif" class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft">The Pain Train</h2>
    <p>Last Friday I rear-ended another individual outside of a Food Lion.  Despite the fact that I was in the wrong, I proceeded to call up my confidant and release the frustration in/with myself unto the unsuspecting victim.  I wished straight menace on this dude, using phrases such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"I hope he stubs his toe."</li>
        <li>"I hope he can't make it to his daughter's wedding."</li>
        <li>"I hope they get his order wrong at the next restaurant he visits."</li>
        <li>"I hope he gets stuck in a situation where he is forced to only listen to Lil Pump."</li>
        <li>"I hope the rest of his life lets him down like S8 Game of Thrones." (I don't even watch GoT.)</li>
        <li>"I hope he becomes allergic to water... spring, tap, ocean, whatever!"</li>
        <li>"I hope he gets convicted of tax fraud."</li>
        <li>"I hope his doctor botches his prostate exam."</li>
        <li>... And many more NSFW phrases that I legally should not type out on this page.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <p>Does the guy deserve all that I wished upon him?  I don't know, I couldn't tell you the type of person he is.  However, had he not been in my way, I wouldn't have rear-ended him...
        So yes, he partially deserves some of these wishes.  Perhaps the less severe ones.  Who am I kidding?  Prime ship him everything I wished, post-haste!
